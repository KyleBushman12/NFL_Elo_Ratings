# NFL_Elo_Ratings

Build an elo rating system for NFL teams. Elo rating systems are a great way to assess team strength. My elo rating system was extremely successful in the 2024 season. After calculating elo ratings since 2018, you can use my code to find the current elo ratings of each team. After you have calculated each team's current elo rating, you can estimate probabilities for the winner of each matchup for that week. When posting this, we just finsihed the final week of the regular season of 2024.
